        <h4>OneRepMax Demo</h4>
        <p>This demo is a web application but use of the OneRepMax library is not limited to web development. This library is based on C#, thus can be used in ASP.NET, console, Windows Forms and WPF applications.</p>
        <p>
            Example: Lifting @weight lbs. @reps times nets an estimated 1RM of @calc.Calculate(weight, reps, formula) lbs.
